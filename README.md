# EKF/UKF Dynamic Device Tracking (MATLAB)

This project implements **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** and **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)** from scratch in MATLAB for tracking dynamic devices under different motion patterns, driving noise, and measurement noise.  
It compares the performance of EKF and UKF in terms of position and velocity accuracy.


## Features
- EKF implementation for nonlinear state estimation  
- UKF implementation with sigma point selection  
- Simulation of dynamic nodes with varying motion patterns  
- Performance evaluation under different noise models  
- Plots and metrics for position and velocity accuracy
## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later (tested)  
- No special toolboxes required (uses base MATLAB functions)
